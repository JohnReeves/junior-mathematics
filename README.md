# junior-mathematics

I have been thinking about writing a series books to introduce advanced mathematics ideas to junior school students

* linear algebra
* Euclidean geometry
* algebraic geometry
* calculus
* probability
* statistics and
* randomised algorithms

## the general ideas

* `Storytelling` weaving mathematical concepts into a narrative or adventure to make the abstract ideas relatable and fun
* `Visual Aids` use of diagrams, illustrations, and animations to clarify the mathematical
* `Interactive Elements` puzzles, experiments, and challenges to encourage hands-on learning
* `Gradual Progression` to break down complex ideas into simpler, age-appropriate steps
* `Applications` highlight real-world uses of the concepts to show their relevance

## algebraic geometry
visually engaging — students can explore shapes, patterns, and the geometry of equations

Concepts like intersections of curves (e.g., circles, lines, parabolas) are intuitive yet profound, offering a natural bridge between geometry and algebra.
Great for fostering spatial reasoning and connecting abstract math to real-world phenomena (e.g., orbits, architecture)

Challenges: Requires careful scaffolding to introduce algebra alongside geometric intuition

## randomized algorithms
fun and interactive — students can experiment with games, simulations, and probabilistic decision-making

Concepts like "guessing," "random walks," or "Monte Carlo methods" can be introduced through playful, hands-on activities

It showcases the power of randomness in problem-solving, sparking curiosity about real-world applications (e.g., cryptography, optimization, AI)

Challenges: Abstract probability concepts may require extra effort to simplify and contextualize for younger audiences

## personal motivation
* `algebraic geometry` for visual exploration and connecting mathematics to the physical world
* `randomised algorithms` for something playful, surprising and technology-oriented

## outline of the randomised algorithms book

unpredictable and hands-on, structure the book with engaging activities and relatable examples 

Introduction to Randomized Algorithms

* The Power of Randomness
  * What is randomness?
  * Fun activities like flipping coins or rolling dice.

* Simple Algorithms
  * `random walks` a game where students "walk" on a grid with random directions
  * `guessing games` efficient strategies using random guesses

* Applications
  * randomness is used in nature (e.g., how animals forage for food)
  * simple Monte Carlo simulations, like estimating the value of π by throwing "random darts" on a grid

* Exploration and Fun Challenges
  * students create their own random games or algorithms
  * eflection on how randomness can solve problems we can't predict

Also, I used to run computer clubs in school where I had Python coding worksheets approximating pi with putting salami on a pizza and JavaScript coding worksheets simulating a genetic algorithm by ‘evolving’ emoji

including historical people and events can make the subject come alive! 

Stories of mathematicians and their discoveries add a human element, showing students how randomness has shaped science and society. For example:

* `John von Neumann` introduce the Monte Carlo method and its origins during WWII.
* `Pierre-Simon Laplace` explore his early work on probability theory.
* `the Gambler’s Fallacy` use real-world anecdotes to teach why randomness can defy intuition.
* `nature’s algorithms` highlight how randomness appears in evolution, weather patterns, or animal behavior.

could frame the book with a storyline where students “join” historical figures on problem-solving adventures

for example, a "time travel club" where students visit key moments in history

* `Laplace’s Probability Parlor` help Pierre-Simon Laplace win a game of chance by applying basic probability rules
* `Von Neumann’s Secret Lab` help in running the Monte Carlo method to estimate outcomes during wartime
* `Darwin’s Random Walk` explore how randomness drives evolution by simulating games with mutations and survival
* `Ada Lovelace’s Code Challenge` program a randomized algorithm on an “early” computer

## activities

* `physical games` create "random walks" by tossing a coin to decide steps in a grid, simulating molecular movement
* `historical challenges` solve problems the way early mathematicians might have—using dice, cards, or other random devices of their time
* `reflection points` highlight how historical events inspired modern concepts in randomness and computation

# background

four characters, three girls and one boy, aged 12 to 14. The boy has autism, with alexithymia and prosopagnosia, with a special interest in mathematics, especially applied mathematics, probability and statistics. The boy is about 13 years old, enjoys reading encyclopedias, mathematics journals and is very precise about the meaning of words. One of the girls is his twin sister, neurotypical, with an interest in languages, art, fashion, literature, music and computing, learning mathematics but not as much as her brother. I am not sure of their names yet. The other two girls are also sisters, the elder sister aged about fifteen, with ADHD and hyperkinetic, always rushing around ‘stirring things up’ and making adventures out of everyday things. Often doing adventurous things like rockclimbing, welding, using windows instead of doors. She is very funny and recognises the boy’s strengths and accommodates his weaknesses of talking and recognising people, having him as a trusted advisor and giving him space to express himself. The other sister is about twelves but tries to act older like her sister, she can do things that her sister likes but not as well and hasn’t yet decided what she is interested in.

## cast of characters

distinct personalities and strengths to offer potential for storytelling and teaching. 

Their dynamics could beautifully showcase the value of collaboration and diversity in problem-solving.

* `the boy` could stimulate the group's problem-solving efforts using his love of mathematical to uncover hidden patterns that help the group succeed in a challenge
* `the twin sister` could bring artistic and linguistic creativity to mathematical concepts, creating visual or poetic explanations for abstract ideas
* `the older sister` could introduce chaos and energy, using her adventurous spirit to inspire real-world experiments in bold, unconventional ways
* `he younger sister` curiosity and desire to emulate her older sister might lead her to discover her own interests as she helps solve challenges with the group

## connection between the mathematical and the artistic

* `Sophie Germain` discovered mathematics aged thirteen and learned Classical Greek and Latin to help her passion, and corresponded with Gauss, Laplace, Legendre and others using a male pseudonym
* `Ada Lovelace` learned mathematics at her mother’s insistence to stop her learning poetry like her father, Byron, and corresponded with British mathematicians of the day, including helping Charles Babbage to design and program their mechanical computer, based on her understanding of mathematics, language and the Jacquard loom card programming methods for making embroidered fabrics
* `Emmy Noether` learned languages first and then studied mathematics with great determination at a time when women were banned from STEM subjects but made fantastic discoveries across modern number theory, geometry and physics partly due to her early training in languages and, of course, her brilliance and determination

## mentors and inspirations for the present day

* `Sophie Germain` might resonate with the twin sister, blending her love for language and mathematics
* `Ada Lovelace` might inspire the younger sister to explore programming or pattern-making as a bridge between art and science
* `Emmy Noether` might serve as a role model for the older sister’s determination and boundary-breaking spirit, showing how passion for learning can defy expectations

## making beautiful textiles

i think i would imagine the autistic boy as less smiley and neater clothes, maybe more black less color, as the color would come from his thoughts. I was wondering about long hair for the twin sister, parting slightly to the left of center, maybe tied in bunches when she is do her art work. her art could complement the boy’s maths, by her drawing artistic curves, geometric shapes and fractals, and the boy working out the mathematics defining them :-)

a costume idea for the twin sister provides a plot idea that would tie in the mathematics, creativity, history and the theme of neurodiversity: the adhd/hyperkinetic girl assembles a jacquard loom to make textiles for the twin-sister to make clothes with. the boy would help with the mathematics and the youngest girl could help with the programming. to help with this, the group could visit ada lovelace who wrote the first computer program for a mathematics algorthm, sophie germain who was very keen on algebraic geometry and number theory, and with emmy noether who was a brilliant mathematician and very keen on helping juniors develop their mathematical abilities. 

The Jacquard loom is a centerpiece that is both historically significant and a  metaphor for weaving diverse talents together and the interactions with historical figures could deepen the plot:

* `Sophie Germain` could encourage the twin sister to explore the artistic beauty of mathematical forms, showing how curves and shapes translate into textiles.
* `Ada Lovelace` might inspire the youngest girl with her pioneering work in programming, offering insights into early algorithmic thinking.
* `Emmy Noether` might guide the boy and the ADHD girl in understanding the mathematical framework behind weaving patterns, emphasizing teamwork and mentorship.
