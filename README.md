# junior-mathematics

I have been thinking about writing a series books to introduce advanced mathematics ideas to junior school students

* linear algebra
* Euclidean geometry
* algebraic geometry
* calculus
* probability
* statistics and
* randomised algorithms

## the general ideas

* `Storytelling` weaving mathematical concepts into a narrative or adventure to make the abstract ideas relatable and fun
* `Visual Aids` use of diagrams, illustrations, and animations to clarify the mathematical
* `Interactive Elements` puzzles, experiments, and challenges to encourage hands-on learning
* `Gradual Progression` to break down complex ideas into simpler, age-appropriate steps
* `Applications` highlight real-world uses of the concepts to show their relevance

## algebraic aeometry
visually engaging — students can explore shapes, patterns, and the geometry of equations

Concepts like intersections of curves (e.g., circles, lines, parabolas) are intuitive yet profound, offering a natural bridge between geometry and algebra.
Great for fostering spatial reasoning and connecting abstract math to real-world phenomena (e.g., orbits, architecture)

Challenges: Requires careful scaffolding to introduce algebra alongside geometric intuition

## randomized algorithms
fun and interactive — students can experiment with games, simulations, and probabilistic decision-making

Concepts like "guessing," "random walks," or "Monte Carlo methods" can be introduced through playful, hands-on activities

It showcases the power of randomness in problem-solving, sparking curiosity about real-world applications (e.g., cryptography, optimization, AI)

Challenges: Abstract probability concepts may require extra effort to simplify and contextualize for younger audiences

## personal motivation
* `algebraic geometry` for visual exploration and connecting mathematics to the physical world
* `randomised algorithms` for something playful, surprising and technology-oriented


## outline of the randomised algorithms book

unpredictable and hands-on, structure the book with engaging activities and relatable examples 

Introduction to Randomized Algorithms

* The Power of Randomness
  * What is randomness?
  * Fun activities like flipping coins or rolling dice.

* Simple Algorithms
  * `random walks` a game where students "walk" on a grid with random directions
  * `guessing games` efficient strategies using random guesses

* Applications
  * randomness is used in nature (e.g., how animals forage for food)
  * simple Monte Carlo simulations, like estimating the value of π by throwing "random darts" on a grid

* Exploration and Fun Challenges
  * students create their own random games or algorithms
  * eflection on how randomness can solve problems we can't predict

Also, I used to run computer clubs in school where I had Python coding worksheets approximating pi with putting salami on a pizza and JavaScript coding worksheets simulating a genetic algorithm by ‘evolving’ emoji

including historical people and events can make the subject come alive! 

Stories of mathematicians and their discoveries add a human element, showing students how randomness has shaped science and society. For example:

* `John von Neumann` introduce the Monte Carlo method and its origins during WWII.
* `Pierre-Simon Laplace` explore his early work on probability theory.
* `the Gambler’s Fallacy` use real-world anecdotes to teach why randomness can defy intuition.
* `nature’s algorithms` highlight how randomness appears in evolution, weather patterns, or animal behavior.

could frame the book with a storyline where students “join” historical figures on problem-solving adventures

for example, a "time travel club" where students visit key moments in history

`Laplace’s Probability Parlor` help Pierre-Simon Laplace win a game of chance by applying basic probability rules
`Von Neumann’s Secret Lab` help in running the Monte Carlo method to estimate outcomes during wartime
`Darwin’s Random Walk` explore how randomness drives evolution by simulating games with mutations and survival
`Ada Lovelace’s Code Challenge` program a randomized algorithm on an “early” computer

activities

`physical games` create "random walks" by tossing a coin to decide steps in a grid, simulating molecular movement
`historical challenges` solve problems the way early mathematicians might have—using dice, cards, or other random devices of their time
`reflection points` highlight how historical events inspired modern concepts in randomness and computation
